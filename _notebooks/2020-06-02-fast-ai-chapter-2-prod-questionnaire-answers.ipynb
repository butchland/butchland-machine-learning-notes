    "    - **pad - add zeros to smaller dimension to make it square**\n",
    "    - **squish - scale bigger dimension to fit into square**\n",
    "    - **squish is used when it is important to include all the image data but the model can tolerate the distortion, crop is useful when partial crops of the image can still be useful in predicting the label, pad is useful when no distortion can be allowed but at the expense of having to pad the images which might decrease the model's performance.** \n",

    "1. What is the difference between `item_tfms` and `batch_tfms`?\n",
    "    - **item_tfms - transforms applied once on each sample while reading the data.**\n",
    "    - **batch_tfms - applied to entire batch - usually using GPU so its fast.**\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "1. What are the downsides of deploying your app to a server, instead of to a client (or edge) device such as a phone or PC?\n",
