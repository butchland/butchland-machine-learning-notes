    "1. Take a look at all the differences between the `Embedding` version of `DotProductBias` and the `create_params` version, and try to understand why each of those changes is required. If you're not sure, try reverting each change to see what happens. (NB: even the type of brackets used in `forward` has changed!)\n",

Look on the book's website and the fast.ai forum for ideas. Note that there are more columns in the full datasetâ€”see if you can use those too (the next chapter might give you ideas).\n",
