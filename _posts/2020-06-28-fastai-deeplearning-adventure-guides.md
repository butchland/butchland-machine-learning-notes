# Fast.ai Deep Learning Adventure Guides

## Summary
**FastAI Deep Learning Adventure Guides** is my proposed initiative to provide first-time fastai learners with a structured schedule and study group lead by more experienced fastai community members on a volunteer basis to make the course more effective and fun.
## Rationale
When I first joined the fastai MOOC around January last year, I first felt very enthusiastic and energized to view the lectures, run the notebooks, participate in the forums and I've learned a lot from the first 4 lectures. 

But as the months passed, my interest waned, not because I wasn't learning anything -- quite the opposite -- I learned more from the fastai MOOC about applying Deep Learning in the real world than I did from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course from Coursera. 

I still listened to the last 3 lectures, I but didn't do the additional coursework that would have cemented the learnings for me. 
By the time the 2nd part of the course came, I had an even harder time catching up, and ended my interest in the latter parts of the Part 2 of the course.

A major factor for this waning interest is that learning remotely can be quite isolating and despite having a fantastic and supportive community in the forums, coupled with the fact that while the course encouraged the application of its learnings to my personal projects, I felt lost in figuring out what personal projects I could pursue to further cement my understanding of the topics.
 
I suspect that I am not alone in this -- there may have been a lot of participants whose interest would not have waned had there been more support for their learning needs. _I know **tenacity** is key to success in this course, but anything we can do to make it more effective is worth pursuing, I think._

So when I got invited to the 2020 live online edition of the fastai course, I was stoked and energized again to deepen my understanding of machine learning and deep learning. 
This time around, I resolved to make my learning more consistent and effective. 

I think I did better this time around (I was able to finish the 8 lectures) and this was due to the fact that during the live online weekly lectures, I joined an online study group -- actually 2 study groups -- the Unofficial SF Study Group (despite the fact that I was based in a timezone 16 hours ahead) and the beginners study group led by Wayde Gilliam every Thursday. 

More than this, the Unofficial Study Group resolved to continue meeting evenafter the end of the live lectures last May 6 to further encourage its members to keep pursuing their learning. 

It has since evolved into 3 related activities:
* A biweekly meeting for presenting projects such as kaggle competitions, and blog posts or software projects
* A weekly book rereading where participants set aside a 3 hour block of time to read a fastbook chapter followed by 30 minute discussion
* An accountability mini-group where we meet weekly to discuss our weekly learning goals and encourage accountability for those goals 

For me, these activities have not only been effective in keeping my interest in the course (aside from participating in the forum discussions) but have also helped relieve the isolation brought on by the COVID19 pandemic quarantines.

Aside from these, the fastai community has (especially during the live lectures) also provided additional activities -- I would highlight the videos and meetings on the fastai source code review as well as other videos by Zach Mueller.
 
These resources have all helped enrich the learning experience, but I think the social experience given by an online study group is the most effective addition to make the fastai learning experience more effective. 

Having had a long experience with conducting trainings on software development, I have thought long and hard about how to make the online fastai learning experience more effective. 
I totally support fastai's goal of democratizing AI and Deep Learning and making it more accessible. 
An important part of this effort is making it more accessible outside of the US, in less developed countries like Asia and Africa (which is why making the lecture transcripts and captions available in other languages is also important).
Also important is making the community more diverse and inclusive, especially in encouraging people from different backgrounds to join the community, making them feel welcome and helping them achieve success in learning deep learning so they can apply it to their domains and environments.
I think one area where the fastai support is lacking is helping those learners who may not have a programming background.
While the fastai's "whole game" approach and goals encourages people  who may not have a strong programming background to learn deep learning and apply it to their domain, I think we can provide ways to support them and get over the initial hump of learning the python basics (plus other software development related stuff like git, using the bash command line).
I think this is quite possible for the fastai community to support -- given that the majority I believe do have programming backgrounds.
  
For these reasons, and based on my experiences, I have come to propose the **FastAI Deep Learning Adventure Guides** as an initiative to help make the online fastai learning experience more effective.
